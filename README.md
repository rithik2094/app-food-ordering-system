In our increasingly fast-paced world, food plays a significant role in our lives. Whether it's a
quick lunch at work or a special meal at a restaurant, the way we order and enjoy food has
evolved with time. To cater to this changing landscape, we've developed a Food Ordering System,
a Java-based application with a user-friendly interface built using Java Swing and MySQL. This
system is designed to simplify the process of ordering food, making it convenient for both
customers and administrators.
